    % the coordinates of the point that lies on the intersection between:

    %   - the vector (B - A), axis rotation of the triangle
    %   - the line that is orthogonal to the vector (B - A) that passes
    %     through UBJ
    % the line that connects the UBJ and the resulting point is the radius
    % of curvature of the trajectory of the UBJ
